How did viewing a diff between two versions 
of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- We only see the lines that are different.
- We can differentiate the lines that were deleted. 
- We can differentitate the lines that were added.

How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- Access to changes made in the past that you don`t remember.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: 
- No middle-lines commits.
- Each change in one commit. 

Contra: 
- You need to remember save the commit. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- Because it is the same 'thing'. Much easier. 

How can you use the commands git log and 
git diff to view the history of files?

- Git log to see all the commits details
- Git diff to compare this commits so we can see
waht changed. 

How might using version control make you more 
confident to make changes that could break something?

- I can restore a version or identify why the bug 
was introduced in order to solve it.
